Radiosondes (or just “sondes”) provide valuable information about how the atmosphere is changing. The sondes will measure temperature, pressure, and humidity, as well as wind speed and direction, as they fly high up to 15-20 miles over the research station. These data will help us to understand the different atmospheric conditions that occur, like clear skies, storms, and windy periods. The next container to be lifted will house a gas generator that will create hydrogen to fill the weather balloons. Then the final container will house the different TONe instruments.

    "section": "",
    "text": "One of the many objectives of our work on the TONe-ICO project is to understand how mass and energy enter and leave Antarctica. It turns out that Antarctic mass balance is a critical component of predicting sea level rise. A warming climate will likely sequester more snow on the continent - a negative contribution. By the reckoning of some, the largest uncertainty in Antarctic mass balance in the 20th century happens to be accumulation in East Antarctica.\nMany aspects that govern these snowfall and accumulation in East Antarctica are poorly parameterized in regional and global models in no small part because this region is complicated. Here we have sea ice, ice shelf, an escarpment of nunataks and glacial outflow, snow, blue ice, dust. So many microclimates, each presenting their own scientific challenges to understand and model.\n\n\n\nmicroclimate 1\n\n\nTroll station sits at one of these prototypical gateways. It’s a perfect place to see how large scale synoptic atmospheric conditions interact with the variable and dynamic surfaces. We brought all the tools we could think of to probe these microclimates, and find that we need more.\n\n\n\nmicroclimate 2\n\n\nThis week, Neely and I had the opportunity to do some exploring the nunatak on which Troll sits. A few views from this exploration led to more questions than answers of how we will try to build a quantitative narrative of this place. Snow and dust come and go. Snow insulates, and reflects solar radiation. Dust and rock heat under the Sun, have high heat capacities, freeze and sequester melted water. There is more bare ice and melt here than ever before according to the ‘locals’.\n\n\n\nNeely on the local nunatak\n\n\nOur exploration this week exposed the need for geologic expertise we are sorely lacking. We found formations that neither of us had ever imagined (see below). I did some basic ‘science’ on these features (poked them with my glove). They felt like rock. We brought pictures back to the station and discover that we weren’t even puzzling over a rock formation, but petral vomit that could be thousands of years old. The avian experts on station said somewhere nearby there is a petral nest also probably thousands of years old - the vomit and doodie stratigraphy telling their own climatic history of the region.\n (photo credit: Neely)\nSo many surprises waiting for us as we assimilate a picture from which we can base predictions of the future. It will definitely take a team to understand this place!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Antarctica is unlike any other place on Earth. It is a continent dedicated to science and cooperation, (relatively) free from territorial disputes or military conflicts— it remains a rare example of what humanity can achieve when we prioritize shared goals over competition. Governed by the Antarctic Treaty System, it is a symbol of what is possible when nations come together to protect a place for peaceful purposes and the pursuit of knowledge.\nBut protecting Antarctica requires effort at every level. It’s not just about the broad, robust international agreements; it’s about the small, everyday actions too. Every scientist, technician, and visitor to the icy expanse plays a role in keeping it pristine. This includes scrubbing boots free of mud and dirt to prevent the introduction of foreign diseases or pollen that could disrupt this fragile environment.\nThe Integrated Cloud Observatory team’s work focuses on placing atmospheric and surface observing instrumentation that will help understand the energy and mass fluxes into Antarctica. By improving our understanding of these processes, we hope to enhance predictions of sea level rise—a critical challenge in the face of climate change. One of the largest uncertainties in Antarctic ice sheet mass balance lies in the accumulation of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. Its behavior is not just a question of regional importance but a factor that influences the entire global climate system.\nAntarctica is special in its own right, a stark and beautiful wilderness that inspires awe and respect. But it’s also a vital piece of the planet’s climate puzzle. To lose it to carelessness or inaction would be a loss for the world. By protecting this extraordinary place—through treaties, through science, and even through scrubbing boots—we protect not just its uniqueness but its role as a cornerstone of Earth’s climate stability.\n\n\n\nMike srubbing his boots free of Cascade mud."
