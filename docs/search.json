They went on a mini-expedition away from Troll Station to “play” in the snow. Specifically, they dug a pit to analyze the structure of the near-surface snow. Snow pit analysis is really important for the type of science that we’re doing at Troll. The stratigraphy (layering) of the top 1 meter of snow can impact how heat and light are transmitted in and out of the snow. So, researchers dig a pit and then sit in it for a couple of hours making measurements of density, conductivity, liquid water content and more. Luckily, it was nice and sunny for this “snow day”!\n\n\n\nMaking measurements in the snow pit\n\n\n\n\n\nA good well done!!"

The sondes will measure temperature, pressure, and humidity, as well as wind speed and direction, as they fly high up to 15-20 miles over the research station. These data will help us to understand the different atmospheric conditions that occur, like clear skies, storms, and windy periods.

Note that the weather balloon reached a maximum altitude of about 30 km! That’s high into the stratosphere! The minimum temperature was -60 C, which was reached at 10 km. This level of the atmosphere is called the “tropopause”, which is the boundary between the troposphere (0 to 10 km) and the stratosphere (10 to 30 km). Also note the blue line which is the relative humidity (RH). Wow, it is dry in the stratosphere above 15 km. The middle panel shows the wind speed (green line) and wind direction (orange line). The maximum winds of almost 30 m/s occurred at 7 km from the west (nearly 270 degrees). The upper left panel shows that the balloon drifted from Troll to the southeast. As stated before, these data are essential for our science. Thanks Troll Team for getting the balloon launcher up and running.\n\n\n\nVery cool figure showing where the weather balloon flew!

    "section": "",
    "text": "One of the many objectives of our work on the TONe-ICO project is to understand how mass and energy enter and leave Antarctica. It turns out that Antarctic mass balance is a critical component of predicting sea level rise. A warming climate will likely sequester more snow on the continent - a negative contribution. By the reckoning of some, the largest uncertainty in Antarctic mass balance in the 20th century happens to be accumulation in East Antarctica.\nMany aspects that govern these snowfall and accumulation in East Antarctica are poorly parameterized in regional and global models in no small part because this region is complicated. Here we have sea ice, ice shelf, an escarpment of nunataks and glacial outflow, snow, blue ice, dust. So many microclimates, each presenting their own scientific challenges to understand and model.\n\n\n\nmicroclimate 1\n\n\nTroll station sits at one of these prototypical gateways. It’s a perfect place to see how large scale synoptic atmospheric conditions interact with the variable and dynamic surfaces. We brought all the tools we could think of to probe these microclimates, and find that we need more.\n\n\n\nmicroclimate 2\n\n\nThis week, Neely and I had the opportunity to do some exploring the nunatak on which Troll sits. A few views from this exploration led to more questions than answers of how we will try to build a quantitative narrative of this place. Snow and dust come and go. Snow insulates, and reflects solar radiation. Dust and rock heat under the Sun, have high heat capacities, freeze and sequester melted water. There is more bare ice and melt here than ever before according to the ‘locals’.\n\n\n\nNeely on the local nunatak\n\n\nOur exploration this week exposed the need for geologic expertise we are sorely lacking. We found formations that neither of us had ever imagined (see below). I did some basic ‘science’ on these features (poked them with my glove). They felt like rock. We brought pictures back to the station and discover that we weren’t even puzzling over a rock formation, but petral vomit that could be thousands of years old. The avian experts on station said somewhere nearby there is a petral nest also probably thousands of years old - the vomit and doodie stratigraphy telling their own climatic history of the region.\n (photo credit: Neely)\nSo many surprises waiting for us as we assimilate a picture from which we can base predictions of the future. It will definitely take a team to understand this place!"

Weather balloons (also called “radiosondes”) are essential for our research. Once they are launched, they transmit valuable information (via radio frequencies) back to Troll Station. The data are temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed and wind direction as a function of height. These data allow our team to characterize the atmospheric conditions during the balloon flight, which is very important for understanding a lot of science, including cloud formation, katabatic winds, and precipitation. The really cool thing about the ICO setup is that this is an automatic radiosonde launcher. Inside this container, the weather balloons are automatically filled with hydrogen gas, which make them very bouyant. The sonde (instrument making the measurements) is attached to the balloon. So when the hatch slides out of the way, the balloon and sonde quickly fly out of the container, and “up, up and away” goes our “beautiful balloon”!\n\n\nVideo\nThere goes our beautiful balloon…"

This degree of precision is unheard of, and due to meticulous efforts of several different crews who laid the foundation, built the framing, and craned and secured the buildings into place.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Antarctica is unlike any other place on Earth. It is a continent dedicated to science and cooperation, (relatively) free from territorial disputes or military conflicts— it remains a rare example of what humanity can achieve when we prioritize shared goals over competition. Governed by the Antarctic Treaty System, it is a symbol of what is possible when nations come together to protect a place for peaceful purposes and the pursuit of knowledge.\nBut protecting Antarctica requires effort at every level. It’s not just about the broad, robust international agreements; it’s about the small, everyday actions too. Every scientist, technician, and visitor to the icy expanse plays a role in keeping it pristine. This includes scrubbing boots free of mud and dirt to prevent the introduction of foreign diseases or pollen that could disrupt this fragile environment.\nThe Integrated Cloud Observatory team’s work focuses on placing atmospheric and surface observing instrumentation that will help understand the energy and mass fluxes into Antarctica. By improving our understanding of these processes, we hope to enhance predictions of sea level rise—a critical challenge in the face of climate change. One of the largest uncertainties in Antarctic ice sheet mass balance lies in the accumulation of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. Its behavior is not just a question of regional importance but a factor that influences the entire global climate system.\nAntarctica is special in its own right, a stark and beautiful wilderness that inspires awe and respect. But it’s also a vital piece of the planet’s climate puzzle. To lose it to carelessness or inaction would be a loss for the world. By protecting this extraordinary place—through treaties, through science, and even through scrubbing boots—we protect not just its uniqueness but its role as a cornerstone of Earth’s climate stability.\n\n\n\nMike srubbing his boots free of Cascade mud."

Troll Station is an inherently interdependent community, which is one of the best aspects of working here. Nevertheless, it can be easy to become hyper focused on one’s own diverse set of responsibilities and lose sight of this. To highlight all the effort necessary to simply run the station we monitored six volunteers with autonomous temperature sensors that are normally used to understand the microclimates around Troll Station for a day. The figure below is a unique illustration of the diverse responsibilities and tasks here at Troll.

    "text": "Ina: Polarsykepleier (Polar Nurse)\n\n\n\nTemperature sensor location: Bukselomme, Trousers pocket\n\n\nPolarsykepleierens Søken: En Dag et Troll\nPå kanten av den frosne verden, der himmelen møter den endeløse isen, legger en skikkelse ut på en edel søken. Ikke en kriger, ikke en trollmann, men en polarsykepleier – en vokter av helse og orden i det kontrollerte kaoset på isens yttergrense.\nMorgenlyset strakte seg over Troll forskningsstasjon, og på sykestua startet dagen. Administrative oppgaver avslørte et presserende behov – førstehjelpsutstyr var modent for utskifting. Bandasjer gulnet, antiseptiske midler var utløpt, og utdatert utstyr bar spor av tidligere ekspedisjoner. Beslutningen ble tatt: ut med det gamle, inn med det nye.\nSøket begynte i lagerrom og kontainere. Krykker eldgamle som isen, sårbandasjer fra en annen tid, kirurgiske instrumenter bedre egnet for et museum enn for en moderne legevakt. Polarsykepleieren og stasjonens lege tok fatt på oppgaven.\nFør middagstid, med en solid vogn, inspiserte de hvert hjørne av stasjonen. Laboratorier, mekaniske huler og skjulte rom – intet førstehjelpsutstyr ble latt ukontrollert. Øyeskyllestasjoner ble etterfylt, AED-er undersøkt, forsyninger hentet.\nDagen bød også på et uventet høydepunkt – et besøk til TONE-observatoriet, hvor skarpe hoder løste himmelens mysterier. Blant teleskoper og data undret de seg over alt som finnes innenfor disse veggene – en påminnelse om den grenseløse nysgjerrigheten som driver menneskelig utforskertrang, selv i de tøffeste miljøer.\nLunsj kl. 11, kaffe kl. 15 – ritualer like hellige som selve isen. Ved dagens slutt var utstyret (nesten) fornyet.\nMens vinden hvisket over de frosne slettene, snudde polarsykepleieren seg og gikk inn igjen – klar for hva morgendagen måtte bringe.\nAt the edge of the frozen world, where the sky meets the endless ice, a lone figure embarks on a noble quest. Not a warrior nor a sorcerer, but a polarsykepleier - guardian of health and order amidst the controlled chaos of Antarctic life.\nThe morning light stretched over Troll research station, and in the infirmary, the day’s mission began. Administrative duties revealed a pressing need - first aid supplies had grown weary with age. Bandages yellowed, antiseptics expired, and outdated equipment whispered of past expeditions. The decision was made - out with the old, in with the new.\nThrough storage rooms and supply caches, the search commenced. Splints as ancient as the ice, wound dressings from another era, and surgical tools better suited for a museum than modern emergency care. The polarsykepleier and the station’s doctor set forth on their next task.\nBy midday, armed with a sturdy trolley, they inspected every corner of the station. Laboratories, mechanical dens, and hidden survival caches - no first-aid kit was left unchecked. Eyewash stations were replenished, AEDs examined, and supplies restored.\nThe day also brought an unexpected highlight - an intriguing visit to the TONE observatory, where the brightest minds unraveled the mysteries of the sky. Among telescopes and data streams, they marveled at the depth of knowledge contained within those walls, a reminder of the boundless curiosity that drives human exploration even in the harshest of environments.\nLunch at 11, coffee at 15 - rituals as sacred as the ice itself. By day’s end, the inventory stood (almost) renewed. As the wind whispered across the frozen plains, the polarsykepleier turned, stepping back inside - ready for whatever tales tomorrow would bring 💁‍♀️"
