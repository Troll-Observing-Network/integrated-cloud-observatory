We’re hoping to have a cloud radar, a depolarization lidar, and a microwave radiometer operating by the end of the austral summer season (late February). We will also have an automatic radiosonde launcher sending daily weather balloons through the atmosphere. We will also be installing iButton temperature sensors around the station; if you don’t know what these are, stayed tuned. It should be an exciting year of new data and new discoveries !!"
