There’s a mix of excitement and nervousness as I juggle the last-minute details and figure out everything that needs to be done before I leave. Packing has become an art form of sorts—balancing what I’ll need against what I think I’ll need and trying not to overdo it. It’s a delicate line to walk, especially knowing that there will be no next-day deliveries if I forget something important.\n\n\n\nA shelf in Neely’s toolbox"

    "text": "2025 will be a BIG year for the TONe Integrated Cloud Observatory. We have an international team of researchers leaving for Troll soon (mid January) to start installing instruments. We’re hoping to have a cloud radar, a depolarization lidar, and a microwave radiometer operating by the end of the austral summer season (late February). We will also have an automatic radiosonde launcher sending daily weather balloons through the atmosphere. We will also be installing iButton temperature sensors around the station; if you don’t know what these are, stayed tuned. It should be an exciting year of new data and new discoveries !!"

The cargo will then be transported (dragged) across the ice shelf and onto the Antarctic continent, then uphill to Troll Station. The cargo will include three “seatainers” that include all of the equipment that will be installed as part of the Integrated Cloud Observatory. Our installation team will start their journey south next week. We’re hoping that the cargo will already be in Troll by the time they arrive. Bon voyage!!\n\n\n\nCargo ship docked at Troll"
