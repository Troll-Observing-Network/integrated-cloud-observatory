We’re hoping to have a cloud radar, a depolarization lidar, and a microwave radiometer operating by the end of the austral summer season (late February). We will also have an automatic radiosonde launcher sending daily weather balloons through the atmosphere. We will also be installing iButton temperature sensors around the station; if you don’t know what these are, stayed tuned. It should be an exciting year of new data and new discoveries !!"

The cargo will then be transported (dragged) across the ice shelf and onto the Antarctic continent, then uphill to Troll Station. The cargo will include three “seatainers” that include all of the equipment that will be installed as part of the Integrated Cloud Observatory. Our installation team will start their journey south next week. We’re hoping that the cargo will already be in Troll by the time they arrive. Bon voyage!!\n\n\n\nCargo ship docked at Troll"

There’s a mix of excitement and nervousness as I juggle the last-minute details and figure out everything that needs to be done before I leave. Packing has become an art form of sorts—balancing what I’ll need against what I think I’ll need and trying not to overdo it.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Antarctica is unlike any other place on Earth. It is a continent dedicated to science and cooperation, (relatively) free from territorial disputes or military conflicts— it remains a rare example of what humanity can achieve when we prioritize shared goals over competition. Governed by the Antarctic Treaty System, it is a symbol of what is possible when nations come together to protect a place for peaceful purposes and the pursuit of knowledge.\nBut protecting Antarctica requires effort at every level. It’s not just about the broad, robust international agreements; it’s about the small, everyday actions too. Every scientist, technician, and visitor to the icy expanse plays a role in keeping it pristine. This includes scrubbing boots free of mud and dirt to prevent the introduction of foreign diseases or pollen that could disrupt this fragile environment.\nThe Integrated Cloud Observatory team’s work focuses on placing atmospheric and surface observing instrumentation that will help understand the energy and mass fluxes into Antarctica. By improving our understanding of these processes, we hope to enhance predictions of sea level rise—a critical challenge in the face of climate change. One of the largest uncertainties in Antarctic ice sheet mass balance lies in the accumulation of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. Its behavior is not just a question of regional importance but a factor that influences the entire global climate system.\nAntarctica is special in its own right, a stark and beautiful wilderness that inspires awe and respect. But it’s also a vital piece of the planet’s climate puzzle. To lose it to carelessness or inaction would be a loss for the world. By protecting this extraordinary place—through treaties, through science, and even through scrubbing boots—we protect not just its uniqueness but its role as a cornerstone of Earth’s climate stability.\n\n\n\nMike srubbing his boots free of Cascade mud."
