<p>All good things must come to an end… The TONe-ICO crew are heading home. During the past five weeks, these hard-working scientists have gone from a half-built foundation to a <a href="tone-ico.jpeg">fully-functional cloud observatory</a>. When they arrived, their four seatainers were still on the Fimbul Ice Shelf. But due to their hard work and <a href="../../posts/thank-you/index.html">help from others</a>, the Integrated Cloud Observatory is “online” and acquiring data. Thanks to Steve Hudson, Marius Bratrein, Ryan Neely III and Mike Town for a job well done! Safe travels!</p>

<p>The Norwegian military motto describes perfectly the feeling we had yesterday as we honored the efforts of the talented and dedicated logistics and construction teams that helped stage and build the ICO facility. One highlight of their collective efforts was when we installed the cloud remote sensing instruments on the building we call the ICO-Hub. Each instrument installed, one after the other, almost perfectly level. This degree of precision is unheard of, and due to meticulous efforts of several different crews who laid the foundation, built the framing, and craned and secured the buildings into place. This sort of quality of work occurred on every front. We celebrated their efforts with a balloon launch, a tour of the different cloud remote-sensing instruments, some Theo’s chocolate from Seattle.</p>
<p>Of course, many others on station have contributed to our success here, to all of whom we are grateful. Here we send a special thank you to: Mads, Even, Ole Edvard, Hans, Theodor, Svein, Richard, Robin, Jørn, Even B, Thomas, Odd Gunnar.</p>

  <title>A day in the life of a Troll</title>

<p>One of the reasons things are going so well thus far in the TONe-ICO project, in fact the main reason, is the support from the talented station staff to help our program happen. Troll Station is an inherently interdependent community, which is one of the best aspects of working here. Nevertheless, it can be easy to become hyper focused on one’s own diverse set of responsibilities and lose sight of this. To highlight all the effort necessary to simply run the station we monitored six volunteers with autonomous temperature sensors that are normally used to understand the microclimates around Troll Station for a day. The figure below is a unique illustration of the diverse responsibilities and tasks here at Troll. Read further for the stories of six Trolls going about their work as told by their temperatures and in their words.</p>

<p>Polarsykepleierens Søken: En Dag et Troll</p>
<p>På kanten av den frosne verden, der himmelen møter den endeløse isen, legger en skikkelse ut på en edel søken. Ikke en kriger, ikke en trollmann, men en polarsykepleier – en vokter av helse og orden i det kontrollerte kaoset på isens yttergrense.</p>
<p>Morgenlyset strakte seg over Troll forskningsstasjon, og på sykestua startet dagen. Administrative oppgaver avslørte et presserende behov – førstehjelpsutstyr var modent for utskifting. Bandasjer gulnet, antiseptiske midler var utløpt, og utdatert utstyr bar spor av tidligere ekspedisjoner. Beslutningen ble tatt: ut med det gamle, inn med det nye.</p>
<p>Søket begynte i lagerrom og kontainere. Krykker eldgamle som isen, sårbandasjer fra en annen tid, kirurgiske instrumenter bedre egnet for et museum enn for en moderne legevakt. Polarsykepleieren og stasjonens lege tok fatt på oppgaven.</p>
<p>Før middagstid, med en solid vogn, inspiserte de hvert hjørne av stasjonen. Laboratorier, mekaniske huler og skjulte rom – intet førstehjelpsutstyr ble latt ukontrollert. Øyeskyllestasjoner ble etterfylt, AED-er undersøkt, forsyninger hentet.</p>
<p>Dagen bød også på et uventet høydepunkt – et besøk til TONE-observatoriet, hvor skarpe hoder løste himmelens mysterier. Blant teleskoper og data undret de seg over alt som finnes innenfor disse veggene – en påminnelse om den grenseløse nysgjerrigheten som driver menneskelig utforskertrang, selv i de tøffeste miljøer.</p>
<p>Lunsj kl. 11, kaffe kl. 15 – ritualer like hellige som selve isen. Ved dagens slutt var utstyret (nesten) fornyet.</p>
<p>Mens vinden hvisket over de frosne slettene, snudde polarsykepleieren seg og gikk inn igjen – klar for hva morgendagen måtte bringe.</p>
<p><em>At the edge of the frozen world, where the sky meets the endless ice, a lone figure embarks on a noble quest. Not a warrior nor a sorcerer, but a polarsykepleier - guardian of health and order amidst the controlled chaos of Antarctic life.</em></p>
<p><em>The morning light stretched over Troll research station, and in the infirmary, the day’s mission began. Administrative duties revealed a pressing need - first aid supplies had grown weary with age. Bandages yellowed, antiseptics expired, and outdated equipment whispered of past expeditions. The decision was made - out with the old, in with the new.</em></p>
<p><em>Through storage rooms and supply caches, the search commenced. Splints as ancient as the ice, wound dressings from another era, and surgical tools better suited for a museum than modern emergency care. The polarsykepleier and the station’s doctor set forth on their next task.</em></p>
<p><em>By midday, armed with a sturdy trolley, they inspected every corner of the station. Laboratories, mechanical dens, and hidden survival caches - no first-aid kit was left unchecked. Eyewash stations were replenished, AEDs examined, and supplies restored.</em></p>
<p><em>The day also brought an unexpected highlight - an intriguing visit to the TONE observatory, where the brightest minds unraveled the mysteries of the sky. Among telescopes and data streams, they marveled at the depth of knowledge contained within those walls, a reminder of the boundless curiosity that drives human exploration even in the harshest of environments.</em></p>
<p><em>Lunch at 11, coffee at 15 - rituals as sacred as the ice itself. By day’s end, the inventory stood (almost) renewed. As the wind whispered across the frozen plains, the polarsykepleier turned, stepping back inside - ready for whatever tales tomorrow would bring 💁‍♀️</em></p>

<p>Hei. Jeg dro ut på TAF (Troll Air Field) fra morgenen, det var arbeid rundt flystripen før lunch og det var mye vind og dårlig sikt. Etter lunch ble været mye bedre og til slutt ble jakken med sensor tatt av, jobbet til kl 18:30 og reiste inn til middag 😄 Kjetil</p>

<p>This is a follow-up blog post to <a href="../../posts/up-up-and-away/index.html">Up, Up and Away</a> about our weather balloon launcher. The red line shows the temperature as a function of altitude. Note that the weather balloon reached a maximum altitude of about 30 km! That’s high into the stratosphere! The minimum temperature was -60 C, which was reached at 10 km. This level of the atmosphere is called the “tropopause”, which is the boundary between the troposphere (0 to 10 km) and the stratosphere (10 to 30 km). Also note the blue line which is the relative humidity (RH). Wow, it is dry in the stratosphere above 15 km. The middle panel shows the wind speed (green line) and wind direction (orange line). The maximum winds of almost 30 m/s occurred at 7 km from the west (nearly 270 degrees). The upper left panel shows that the balloon drifted from Troll to the southeast. As stated before, these data are essential for our science. Thanks Troll Team for getting the balloon launcher up and running.</p>

<p>As the old song by the 5th Dimension goes, “Up, up and away. My beautiful, my beautiful balloon”. That is how the ICO researchers feel about this balloon. Weather balloons (also called “radiosondes”) are essential for our research. Once they are launched, they transmit valuable information (via radio frequencies) back to Troll Station. The data are temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed and wind direction as a function of height. These data allow our team to characterize the atmospheric conditions during the balloon flight, which is very important for understanding a lot of science, including cloud formation, katabatic winds, and precipitation. The really cool thing about the ICO setup is that this is an automatic radiosonde launcher. Inside this container, the weather balloons are automatically filled with hydrogen gas, which make them very bouyant. The sonde (instrument making the measurements) is attached to the balloon. So when the hatch slides out of the way, the balloon and sonde quickly fly out of the container, and “up, up and away” goes our “beautiful balloon”!</p>

  <title>It’s a SNOW DAY!</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Schools occasionally have a “snow day”, when school is cancelled because of a big snow storm. But our research team recently had a different type of “snow day”. They went on a mini-expedition away from Troll Station to “play” in the snow. Specifically, they dug a pit to analyze the structure of the near-surface snow. Snow pit analysis is really important for the type of science that we’re doing at Troll. The stratigraphy (layering) of the top 1 meter of snow can impact how heat and light are transmitted in and out of the snow. So, researchers dig a pit and then sit in it for a couple of hours making measurements of density, conductivity, liquid water content and more. Luckily, it was nice and sunny for this “snow day”!</p>

<p>The cloud radar has been installed on the roof of the ICO-Hub building! In addition, it has been connected to the computer and is scanning. This is a huge step forward in getting the Integrated Cloud Observatory at full capacity, because the cloud radar is our most complicated instrument. Our next challenge is for the science team to decide on a scanning schedule; there are so many possibilities with this radar!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>It’s happening! Data is flowing! After only a couple weeks at Troll Station, our deployment crew has overseen:</p>
<ul>
<li>the transport of all of our cargo from the ship to the station,</li>
<li>the construction of the ICO platform,</li>
<li>the installation of the three seatianers on the platform,</li>
<li>the placement of the roof rack on the ICO-Hub container,</li>
<li>the mounting of instruments on the roof rack,</li>
<li>setup of the ICO computer system,</li>
<li>and now the flow of data!</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to our deployment crew and all the help from various personnel at Troll Station that made this milestone possible. Science is hard work, so collaboration is essential. And it’s clear that the folks at Troll have worked hard over the past few weeks to make this happen. Next up; DATA ANALYSIS!!</p>

<p>The instruments are starting to be assembled at Troll. Check out the image below of the stand for the RPG Cloud Radar. This instrument will be a central piece of our scientific equipment at the ICO. This radar can scan and look at different places in the atmosphere over Troll Station and will tell us where clouds are and what their properties are. I can also see the Vaisala Cloud Lidar in the lower left, which I’m sure will be up and running soon. It’s really exciting to see things literally “coming together”!</p>

  <title>One big lift</title>
  <dc:creator>Von P. Walden</dc:creator>
  <link>https://troll-observing-network.github.io/integrated-cloud-observatory/posts/one-big-lift/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>One big lift for TONe ICO, and one big lift for science at Troll! The first container was lifted onto the TONe ICO platform today. This container will house the automatic radiosonde launcher. Radiosonde are “weather balloons” that ICO will launch every day. Radiosondes (or just “sondes”) provide valuable information about how the atmosphere is changing. The sondes will measure temperature, pressure, and humidity, as well as wind speed and direction, as they fly high up to 15-20 miles over the research station. These data will help us to understand the different atmospheric conditions that occur, like clear skies, storms, and windy periods. The next container to be lifted will house a gas generator that will create hydrogen to fill the weather balloons. Then the final container will house the different TONe instruments. More on that soon…</p>

  <title>Microclimates are full of surprises</title>
  <dc:creator>Michael S. Town</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>One of the many objectives of our work on the TONe-ICO project is to understand how mass and energy enter and leave Antarctica. It turns out that Antarctic mass balance is a critical component of predicting sea level rise. A warming climate will likely sequester more snow on the continent - a negative contribution. By the reckoning of some, the largest uncertainty in Antarctic mass balance in the 20th century happens to be accumulation in East Antarctica.</p>
<p>Many aspects that govern these snowfall and accumulation in East Antarctica are poorly parameterized in regional and global models in no small part because this region is <em>complicated</em>. Here we have sea ice, ice shelf, an escarpment of nunataks and glacial outflow, snow, blue ice, dust. So many microclimates, each presenting their own scientific challenges to understand and model.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p>Troll station sits at one of these prototypical gateways. It’s a perfect place to see how large scale synoptic atmospheric conditions interact with the variable and dynamic surfaces. We brought all the tools we could think of to probe these microclimates, and find that we need more.</p>

<p>This week, Neely and I had the opportunity to do some exploring the nunatak on which Troll sits. A few views from this exploration led to more questions than answers of how we will try to build a quantitative narrative of this place. Snow and dust come and go. Snow insulates, and reflects solar radiation. Dust and rock heat under the Sun, have high heat capacities, freeze and sequester melted water. There is more bare ice and melt here than ever before according to the ‘locals’.</p>

<p>Our exploration this week exposed the need for geologic expertise we are sorely lacking. We found formations that neither of us had ever imagined (see below). I did some basic ‘science’ on these features (poked them with my glove). They felt like rock. We brought pictures back to the station and discover that we weren’t even puzzling over a rock formation, but petral vomit that could be thousands of years old. The avian experts on station said somewhere nearby there is a petral nest also probably thousands of years old - the vomit and doodie stratigraphy telling their own climatic history of the region.</p>

<p>So many surprises waiting for us as we assimilate a picture from which we can base predictions of the future. It will definitely take a team to understand this place!</p>

<p>For the next 37 days, Troll is our home—our entire world. Everything we need to live and work is basically within the edges of this picture. There’s no way to get anything else until the next flight arrives in mid-February, so we make the most of what we have here.</p>
<p>We all sleep in the long, blue building perched partway up the hill. It’s constructed from containers, cleverly partitioned into rooms. It reminds me alot of being in college. I even had my name on a whiteboard welcoming me on the outside of my door.</p>
<p>All meals and station activities take place in the bright red building, the central hub of the station. It’s also the only spot where you’ll find a proper bathroom.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>After years of planning and a five-and-a-half-hour flight from Cape Town, we finally touched down at Troll Airfield at 3:30 UTC (local time here). The experience was nothing short of surreal.</p>
<p>The Boeing 737 glided smoothly onto the ice sheet as if it were landing on a conventional runway anywhere else. From the comfort of a “normal” plane seat, I gazed out the window at the vast, otherworldly expanse of East Antarctica, a sharp contrast with being on a plane I would typically take from Leeds to Oslo.</p>
<p>It was a moment where the extraordinary felt almost ordinary—a juxtaposition that will stay with me for a lifetime.</p>
<p>After being ushered away from the plane, we were greeted by friends old and new in the “Arrivals” area, doubling up as summer barbeque. I promptly grabbed a sausage and toasted bun from the grill before being whisked off to the station on a tracked personnel carrier.</p>

His research focuses mostly on the ways in which ice and snow interact with sunlight to affect Earth’s climate. He became fascinated by the polar regions before high school, and by university, he set his sights on spending a winter at the South Pole. In 2001, he lived this dream during graduate school, sparking a passion for fieldwork that’s taken him on multiple trips to both the Arctic and Antarctic.

![Steve](steve.jpg){width=50%}

Marius Bratrein (Electrical Engineer) is an Instrumentation Engineer within the [Norwegian Polar Institute](https://www.npolar.no/). Marius has a broad background in electrical engineering, instrumentation, logisitics and polar exploration.  Marius has worked hand in hand with Steve to prepare everything for the expedition to Troll.

![Marius](marius.png){width=50%}

Dr Michael (Mike) Town (Climate Scientist) is the Vice President of and Researcher at [Earth and Space Research] (https://www.esr.org/). Similar to Steve, Mike also dreamed of adventurous fieldwork from an early age and had these fullfilled in graduate school by wintering over at the South Pole alngside Steve in 2001. Mike current research focuses on the surface energy budget over polar snow. 

![Mike](mike.jpg){width=50%}

Even Birkeland (Engineer) is a Project Engineer within Norwegian Polar Institute supporting the [TONe](https://www.npolar.no/en/tone/) project. Even has previously spent a year at Troll and brings valuable local knowledge along with technical and logisitical expertise support to the project.

  <title>A different type of train</title>
  <dc:creator>Von P. Walden</dc:creator>
  <link>https://troll-observing-network.github.io/integrated-cloud-observatory/posts/a-different-type-of-train/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>This might be a different type of train than you’re used to. First of all, this train travels on skis, not tracks. Second, this train will travel across the Fimbul Ice Shelf and then onto the Antarctic continent at Troll Station. It will deliver some very important cargo for the ICO. Some of the containers shown in the image contain equipment for the ICO and will soon become buildings that house the ICO. Our field team is flying to Cape Town today and is super happy (and relieved) to see this train moving!!</p>

  <title>First stop. Prague</title>
  <dc:creator>Steve Hudson</dc:creator>
  <link>https://troll-observing-network.github.io/integrated-cloud-observatory/posts/first-stop-Prague/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>We just landed in Prague. Annoying because I’ve never been here but only the crew are getting off the plane (and it’s midnight). The business class level meal between Oslo and here was a pleasant surprise though.</p>
<p>Our flight plan is Oslo - Prague - Abuja, Nigeria -&gt; Cape Town -&gt; Troll. We’ll stay in Cape Town for just enough time for the flight crew to rest. Then it’s down to Troll, where we land on a runway made of ice. There’s about a mile of ice below it before you hit rock. Sounds good, right?</p>

<p>The TONe ICO team is “on the move”. Marius Bratrein, Steve Hudson, Ryan Neely III, and Mike Town have started their journey south. WAY SOUTH to -72 S!! The pictures below show them at the airport with their luggage. These bags contain extreme cold weather (ECW) clothing and a few scientific instruments, plus any last-minute items that will be needed. The team should arrive at Troll Station in a few days after flying from Oslo to Cape Town to Troll. That’s a long trip… But it’s good to finally be “on the move”!</p>

  <title>Antarctica: A Special Place Worth Protecting</title>
  <dc:creator>Michael S. Town</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Antarctica is unlike any other place on Earth. It is a continent dedicated to science and cooperation, (relatively) free from territorial disputes or military conflicts— it remains a rare example of what humanity can achieve when we prioritize shared goals over competition. Governed by the Antarctic Treaty System, it is a symbol of what is possible when nations come together to protect a place for peaceful purposes and the pursuit of knowledge.</p>
<p>But protecting Antarctica requires effort at every level. It’s not just about the broad, robust international agreements; it’s about the small, everyday actions too. Every scientist, technician, and visitor to the icy expanse plays a role in keeping it pristine. This includes scrubbing boots free of mud and dirt to prevent the introduction of foreign diseases or pollen that could disrupt this fragile environment.</p>
<p>The Integrated Cloud Observatory team’s work focuses on placing atmospheric and surface observing instrumentation that will help understand the energy and mass fluxes into Antarctica. By improving our understanding of these processes, we hope to enhance predictions of sea level rise—a critical challenge in the face of climate change. One of the largest uncertainties in Antarctic ice sheet mass balance lies in the accumulation of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. Its behavior is not just a question of regional importance but a factor that influences the entire global climate system.</p>
<p>Antarctica is special in its own right, a stark and beautiful wilderness that inspires awe and respect. But it’s also a vital piece of the planet’s climate puzzle. To lose it to carelessness or inaction would be a loss for the world. By protecting this extraordinary place—through treaties, through science, and even through scrubbing boots—we protect not just its uniqueness but its role as a cornerstone of Earth’s climate stability.</p>

  <title>Packing Up in the UK</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>It’s getting close to being time to go, and the reality of the trip is starting to sink in. There’s a mix of excitement and nervousness as I juggle the last-minute details and figure out everything that needs to be done before I leave. Packing has become an art form of sorts—balancing what I’ll need against what I think I’ll need and trying not to overdo it. It’s a delicate line to walk, especially knowing that there will be no next-day deliveries if I forget something important.</p>
