<p>The instruments are starting to be assembled at Troll. Check out the image below of the stand for the RPG Cloud Radar. This instrument will be a central piece of our scientific equipment at the ICO. This radar can scan and look at different places in the atmosphere over Troll Station and will tell us where clouds are and what their properties are. I can also see the Vaisala Cloud Lidar in the lower left, which I’m sure will be up and running soon. It’s really exciting to see things literally “coming together”!</p>

  <title>One big lift</title>
  <dc:creator>Von P. Walden</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>One big lift for TONe ICO, and one big lift for science at Troll! The first container was lifted onto the TONe ICO platform today. This container will house the automatic radiosonde launcher. Radiosonde are “weather balloons” that ICO will launch every day. Radiosondes (or just “sondes”) provide valuable information about how the atmosphere is changing. The sondes will measure temperature, pressure, and humidity, as well as wind speed and direction, as they fly high up to 15-20 miles over the research station. These data will help us to understand the different atmospheric conditions that occur, like clear skies, storms, and windy periods. The next container to be lifted will house a gas generator that will create hydrogen to fill the weather balloons. Then the final container will house the different TONe instruments. More on that soon…</p>

  <title>Microclimates are full of surprises</title>
  <dc:creator>Michael S. Town</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>One of the many objectives of our work on the TONe-ICO project is to understand how mass and energy enter and leave Antarctica. It turns out that Antarctic mass balance is a critical component of predicting sea level rise. A warming climate will likely sequester more snow on the continent - a negative contribution. By the reckoning of some, the largest uncertainty in Antarctic mass balance in the 20th century happens to be accumulation in East Antarctica.</p>
<p>Many aspects that govern these snowfall and accumulation in East Antarctica are poorly parameterized in regional and global models in no small part because this region is <em>complicated</em>. Here we have sea ice, ice shelf, an escarpment of nunataks and glacial outflow, snow, blue ice, dust. So many microclimates, each presenting their own scientific challenges to understand and model.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p>Troll station sits at one of these prototypical gateways. It’s a perfect place to see how large scale synoptic atmospheric conditions interact with the variable and dynamic surfaces. We brought all the tools we could think of to probe these microclimates, and find that we need more.</p>

<p>This week, Neely and I had the opportunity to do some exploring the nunatak on which Troll sits. A few views from this exploration led to more questions than answers of how we will try to build a quantitative narrative of this place. Snow and dust come and go. Snow insulates, and reflects solar radiation. Dust and rock heat under the Sun, have high heat capacities, freeze and sequester melted water. There is more bare ice and melt here than ever before according to the ‘locals’.</p>

<p>Our exploration this week exposed the need for geologic expertise we are sorely lacking. We found formations that neither of us had ever imagined (see below). I did some basic ‘science’ on these features (poked them with my glove). They felt like rock. We brought pictures back to the station and discover that we weren’t even puzzling over a rock formation, but petral vomit that could be thousands of years old. The avian experts on station said somewhere nearby there is a petral nest also probably thousands of years old - the vomit and doodie stratigraphy telling their own climatic history of the region.</p>

<p>So many surprises waiting for us as we assimilate a picture from which we can base predictions of the future. It will definitely take a team to understand this place!</p>

  <title>Our Home Away from Home</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>For the next 37 days, Troll is our home—our entire world. Everything we need to live and work is basically within the edges of this picture. There’s no way to get anything else until the next flight arrives in mid-February, so we make the most of what we have here.</p>
<p>We all sleep in the long, blue building perched partway up the hill. It’s constructed from containers, cleverly partitioned into rooms. It reminds me alot of being in college. I even had my name on a whiteboard welcoming me on the outside of my door.</p>
<p>All meals and station activities take place in the bright red building, the central hub of the station. It’s also the only spot where you’ll find a proper bathroom.</p>

  <title>Arrived</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>After years of planning and a five-and-a-half-hour flight from Cape Town, we finally touched down at Troll Airfield at 3:30 UTC (local time here). The experience was nothing short of surreal.</p>
<p>The Boeing 737 glided smoothly onto the ice sheet as if it were landing on a conventional runway anywhere else. From the comfort of a “normal” plane seat, I gazed out the window at the vast, otherworldly expanse of East Antarctica, a sharp contrast with being on a plane I would typically take from Leeds to Oslo.</p>
<p>It was a moment where the extraordinary felt almost ordinary—a juxtaposition that will stay with me for a lifetime.</p>
<p>After being ushered away from the plane, we were greeted by friends old and new in the “Arrivals” area, doubling up as summer barbeque. I promptly grabbed a sausage and toasted bun from the grill before being whisked off to the station on a tracked personnel carrier.</p>

His research focuses mostly on the ways in which ice and snow interact with sunlight to affect Earth’s climate. He became fascinated by the polar regions before high school, and by university, he set his sights on spending a winter at the South Pole. In 2001, he lived this dream during graduate school, sparking a passion for fieldwork that’s taken him on multiple trips to both the Arctic and Antarctic.

![Steve](steve.jpg){width=50%}

Marius Bratrein (Electrical Engineer) is an Instrumentation Engineer within the [Norwegian Polar Institute](https://www.npolar.no/). Marius has a broad background in electrical engineering, instrumentation, logisitics and polar exploration.  Marius has worked hand in hand with Steve to prepare everything for the expedition to Troll.

![Marius](marius.png){width=50%}

Dr Michael (Mike) Town (Climate Scientist) is the Vice President of and Researcher at [Earth and Space Research] (https://www.esr.org/). Similar to Steve, Mike also dreamed of adventurous fieldwork from an early age and had these fullfilled in graduate school by wintering over at the South Pole alngside Steve in 2001. Mike current research focuses on the surface energy budget over polar snow. 

![Mike](mike.jpg){width=50%}

Even Birkeland (Engineer) is a Project Engineer within Norwegian Polar Institute supporting the [TONe](https://www.npolar.no/en/tone/) project. Even has previously spent a year at Troll and brings valuable local knowledge along with technical and logisitical expertise support to the project.

  <title>First stop. Prague</title>
  <dc:creator>Steve Hudson</dc:creator>
  <link>https://troll-observing-network.github.io/integrated-cloud-observatory/posts/first-stop-Prague/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>We just landed in Prague. Annoying because I’ve never been here but only the crew are getting off the plane (and it’s midnight). The business class level meal between Oslo and here was a pleasant surprise though.</p>
<p>Our flight plan is Oslo - Prague - Abuja, Nigeria -&gt; Cape Town -&gt; Troll. We’ll stay in Cape Town for just enough time for the flight crew to rest. Then it’s down to Troll, where we land on a runway made of ice. There’s about a mile of ice below it before you hit rock. Sounds good, right?</p>

  <title>A different type of train</title>
  <dc:creator>Von P. Walden</dc:creator>
  <link>https://troll-observing-network.github.io/integrated-cloud-observatory/posts/a-different-type-of-train/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>This might be a different type of train than you’re used to. First of all, this train travels on skis, not tracks. Second, this train will travel across the Fimbul Ice Shelf and then onto the Antarctic continent at Troll Station. It will deliver some very important cargo for the ICO. Some of the containers shown in the image contain equipment for the ICO and will soon become buildings that house the ICO. Our field team is flying to Cape Town today and is super happy (and relieved) to see this train moving!!</p>

  <title>On the move…</title>

<p>The TONe ICO team is “on the move”. Marius Bratrein, Steve Hudson, Ryan Neely III, and Mike Town have started their journey south. WAY SOUTH to -72 S!! The pictures below show them at the airport with their luggage. These bags contain extreme cold weather (ECW) clothing and a few scientific instruments, plus any last-minute items that will be needed. The team should arrive at Troll Station in a few days after flying from Oslo to Cape Town to Troll. That’s a long trip… But it’s good to finally be “on the move”!</p>

  <title>Antarctica: A Special Place Worth Protecting</title>
  <dc:creator>Michael S. Town</dc:creator>
  <link>https://troll-observing-network.github.io/integrated-cloud-observatory/posts/antarctica-is-a-special-place-worth-protecting/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Antarctica is unlike any other place on Earth. It is a continent dedicated to science and cooperation, (relatively) free from territorial disputes or military conflicts— it remains a rare example of what humanity can achieve when we prioritize shared goals over competition. Governed by the Antarctic Treaty System, it is a symbol of what is possible when nations come together to protect a place for peaceful purposes and the pursuit of knowledge.</p>
<p>But protecting Antarctica requires effort at every level. It’s not just about the broad, robust international agreements; it’s about the small, everyday actions too. Every scientist, technician, and visitor to the icy expanse plays a role in keeping it pristine. This includes scrubbing boots free of mud and dirt to prevent the introduction of foreign diseases or pollen that could disrupt this fragile environment.</p>
<p>The Integrated Cloud Observatory team’s work focuses on placing atmospheric and surface observing instrumentation that will help understand the energy and mass fluxes into Antarctica. By improving our understanding of these processes, we hope to enhance predictions of sea level rise—a critical challenge in the face of climate change. One of the largest uncertainties in Antarctic ice sheet mass balance lies in the accumulation of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. Its behavior is not just a question of regional importance but a factor that influences the entire global climate system.</p>
<p>Antarctica is special in its own right, a stark and beautiful wilderness that inspires awe and respect. But it’s also a vital piece of the planet’s climate puzzle. To lose it to carelessness or inaction would be a loss for the world. By protecting this extraordinary place—through treaties, through science, and even through scrubbing boots—we protect not just its uniqueness but its role as a cornerstone of Earth’s climate stability.</p>

  <title>Packing Up in the UK</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>It’s getting close to being time to go, and the reality of the trip is starting to sink in. There’s a mix of excitement and nervousness as I juggle the last-minute details and figure out everything that needs to be done before I leave. Packing has become an art form of sorts—balancing what I’ll need against what I think I’ll need and trying not to overdo it. It’s a delicate line to walk, especially knowing that there will be no next-day deliveries if I forget something important.</p>

  <title>Cargo ship docked at Troll</title>
  <dc:creator>Von P. Walden</dc:creator>
  <link>https://troll-observing-network.github.io/integrated-cloud-observatory/posts/ship-docked-at-ice-shelf/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>The cargo ship for Troll Station has docked to the Fimbul Ice Shelf. The cargo must now be offloaded onto the ice shelf using the enormous cranes on the ship. The cargo will then be transported (dragged) across the ice shelf and onto the Antarctic continent, then uphill to Troll Station. The cargo will include three “seatainers” that include all of the equipment that will be installed as part of the Integrated Cloud Observatory. Our installation team will start their journey south next week. We’re hoping that the cargo will already be in Troll by the time they arrive. Bon voyage!!</p>

  <title>Happy New Year!</title>
  <dc:creator>Von P. Walden</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>2025 will be a BIG year for the TONe Integrated Cloud Observatory. We have an international team of researchers leaving for Troll soon (mid January) to start installing instruments. We’re hoping to have a cloud radar, a depolarization lidar, and a microwave radiometer operating by the end of the austral summer season (late February). We will also have an automatic radiosonde launcher sending daily weather balloons through the atmosphere. We will also be installing iButton temperature sensors around the station; if you don’t know what these are, stayed tuned. It should be an exciting year of new data and new discoveries !!</p>
