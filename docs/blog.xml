  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>After years of planning and a five-and-a-half-hour flight from Cape Town, we finally touched down at Troll Airfield at 3:30 UTC (local time here). The experience was nothing short of surreal.</p>
<p>The Boeing 737 glided smoothly onto the ice sheet as if it were landing on a conventional runway anywhere else. From the comfort of a “normal” plane seat, I gazed out the window at the vast, otherworldly expanse of East Antarctica, a sharp contrast with being on a plane I would typically take from Leeds to Oslo.</p>
<p>It was a moment where the extraordinary felt almost ordinary—a juxtaposition that will stay with me for a lifetime.</p>
<p>After being ushered away from the plane, we were greeted by friends old and new in the “Arrivals” area, doubling up as summer barbeque. I promptly grabbed a sausage and toasted bun from the grill before being whisked off to the station on a tracked personnel carrier.</p>

  <title>A different type of train</title>
  <dc:creator>Von P. Walden</dc:creator>
  <link>https://troll-observing-network.github.io/integrated-cloud-observatory/posts/a-different-type-of-train/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>This might be a different type of train than you’re used to. First of all, this train travels on skis, not tracks. Second, this train will travel across the Fimbul Ice Shelf and then onto the Antarctic continent at Troll Station. It will deliver some very important cargo for the ICO. Some of the containers shown in the image contain equipment for the ICO and will soon become buildings that house the ICO. Our field team is flying to Cape Town today and is super happy (and relieved) to see this train moving!!</p>

  <title>First stop. Prague</title>
  <dc:creator>Steve Hudson</dc:creator>
  <link>https://troll-observing-network.github.io/integrated-cloud-observatory/posts/first-stop-Prague/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>We just landed in Prague. Annoying because I’ve never been here but only the crew are getting off the plane (and it’s midnight). The business class level meal between Oslo and here was a pleasant surprise though.</p>
<p>Our flight plan is Oslo - Prague - Abuja, Nigeria -&gt; Cape Town -&gt; Troll. We’ll stay in Cape Town for just enough time for the flight crew to rest. Then it’s down to Troll, where we land on a runway made of ice. There’s about a mile of ice below it before you hit rock. Sounds good, right?</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>The TONe ICO team is “on the move”. Marius Bratrein, Steve Hudson, Ryan Neely III, and Mike Town have started their journey south. WAY SOUTH to -72 S!! The pictures below show them at the airport with their luggage. These bags contain extreme cold weather (ECW) clothing and a few scientific instruments, plus any last-minute items that will be needed. The team should arrive at Troll Station in a few days after flying from Oslo to Cape Town to Troll. That’s a long trip… But it’s good to finally be “on the move”!</p>

  <title>Antarctica: A Special Place Worth Protecting</title>
  <dc:creator>Michael S. Town</dc:creator>
  <link>https://troll-observing-network.github.io/integrated-cloud-observatory/posts/antarctica-is-a-special-place-worth-protecting/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Antarctica is unlike any other place on Earth. It is a continent dedicated to science and cooperation, (relatively) free from territorial disputes or military conflicts— it remains a rare example of what humanity can achieve when we prioritize shared goals over competition. Governed by the Antarctic Treaty System, it is a symbol of what is possible when nations come together to protect a place for peaceful purposes and the pursuit of knowledge.</p>
<p>But protecting Antarctica requires effort at every level. It’s not just about the broad, robust international agreements; it’s about the small, everyday actions too. Every scientist, technician, and visitor to the icy expanse plays a role in keeping it pristine. This includes scrubbing boots free of mud and dirt to prevent the introduction of foreign diseases or pollen that could disrupt this fragile environment.</p>
<p>The Integrated Cloud Observatory team’s work focuses on placing atmospheric and surface observing instrumentation that will help understand the energy and mass fluxes into Antarctica. By improving our understanding of these processes, we hope to enhance predictions of sea level rise—a critical challenge in the face of climate change. One of the largest uncertainties in Antarctic ice sheet mass balance lies in the accumulation of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. Its behavior is not just a question of regional importance but a factor that influences the entire global climate system.</p>
<p>Antarctica is special in its own right, a stark and beautiful wilderness that inspires awe and respect. But it’s also a vital piece of the planet’s climate puzzle. To lose it to carelessness or inaction would be a loss for the world. By protecting this extraordinary place—through treaties, through science, and even through scrubbing boots—we protect not just its uniqueness but its role as a cornerstone of Earth’s climate stability.</p>

  <title>Packing Up in the UK</title>

  <link>https://troll-observing-network.github.io/integrated-cloud-observatory/posts/packing-up/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>It’s getting close to being time to go, and the reality of the trip is starting to sink in. There’s a mix of excitement and nervousness as I juggle the last-minute details and figure out everything that needs to be done before I leave. Packing has become an art form of sorts—balancing what I’ll need against what I think I’ll need and trying not to overdo it. It’s a delicate line to walk, especially knowing that there will be no next-day deliveries if I forget something important.</p>

  <title>Cargo ship docked at Troll</title>
  <dc:creator>Von P. Walden</dc:creator>
  <link>https://troll-observing-network.github.io/integrated-cloud-observatory/posts/ship-docked-at-ice-shelf/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>The cargo ship for Troll Station has docked to the Fimbul Ice Shelf. The cargo must now be offloaded onto the ice shelf using the enormous cranes on the ship. The cargo will then be transported (dragged) across the ice shelf and onto the Antarctic continent, then uphill to Troll Station. The cargo will include three “seatainers” that include all of the equipment that will be installed as part of the Integrated Cloud Observatory. Our installation team will start their journey south next week. We’re hoping that the cargo will already be in Troll by the time they arrive. Bon voyage!!</p>

  <title>Happy New Year!</title>
  <dc:creator>Von P. Walden</dc:creator>
  <link>https://troll-observing-network.github.io/integrated-cloud-observatory/posts/Troll2025/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>2025 will be a BIG year for the TONe Integrated Cloud Observatory. We have an international team of researchers leaving for Troll soon (mid January) to start installing instruments. We’re hoping to have a cloud radar, a depolarization lidar, and a microwave radiometer operating by the end of the austral summer season (late February). We will also have an automatic radiosonde launcher sending daily weather balloons through the atmosphere. We will also be installing iButton temperature sensors around the station; if you don’t know what these are, stayed tuned. It should be an exciting year of new data and new discoveries !!</p>
