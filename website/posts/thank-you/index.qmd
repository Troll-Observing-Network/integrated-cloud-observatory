The Norwegian military motto describes perfectly the feeling we had yesterday as we honored the efforts of the talented and dedicated logistics and construction teams that helped stage and build the ICO facility. One highlight of their collective efforts was when we installed the cloud remote sensing instruments on the building we call the ICO-Hub. Each instrument installed, one after the other, almost perfectly level. This degree of precision is unheard of, and due to meticulous efforts of several different crews who laid the foundation, built the framing, and craned and secured the buildings into place. This sort of quality of work occurred on every front. We celebrated their efforts with a balloon launch, a tour of the different cloud remote-sensing instruments, some Theo's chocolate from Seattle.

Of course, many others on station have contributed to our success here, to all of whom we are grateful. Here we send a special thank you to: Mads, Even, Ole Edvard, Hans, Theodor, Svein, Richard, Robin, JÃ¸rn, Even B, Thomas, Odd Gunnar.
