2025 will be a BIG year for the TONe Integrated Cloud Observatory. 
We have an international team of researchers leaving for Troll soon (mid January) to start installing
instruments. We're hoping to have a cloud radar, a depolarization lidar, and a microwave radiometer
operating by the end of the austral summer season (late February). We will also have an automatic radiosonde
launcher sending daily weather balloons through the atmosphere. We will also be installing iButton
temperature sensors around the station; if you don't know what these are, stayed tuned. 
It should be an exciting year of new data and new discoveries !!
