The cloud radar has been installed on the roof of the ICO-Hub building! In addition, it has been connected to the computer and is scanning. This is a huge step forward in getting the Integrated Cloud Observatory at full capacity, because the cloud radar is our most complicated instrument. Our next challenge is for the science team to decide on a scanning schedule; there are so many possibility with this radar!
