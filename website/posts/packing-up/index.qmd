It’s getting close to being time to go, and the reality of the trip is starting to sink in. There’s a mix of excitement and nervousness as I juggle the last-minute details and figure out everything that needs to be done before I leave. Packing has become an art form of sorts—balancing what I’ll need against what I think I’ll need and trying not to overdo it. It’s a delicate line to walk, especially knowing that there will be no next-day deliveries if I forget something important.
