## Dr. Stephen (Steve) Hudson  
**Expedition Leader**  
Senior Researcher at the [Norwegian Polar Institute](https://www.npolar.no/)

Dr. Hudson leads the work package responsible for developing the Integrated Cloud Observatory with [TONe](https://www.npolar.no/en/tone/). His research focuses on how ice and snow interact with sunlight to affect Earth’s climate. Fascinated by polar regions since high school, Steve spent a winter at the South Pole in 2001 during graduate school. This experience sparked a passion for fieldwork, leading to multiple Arctic and Antarctic expeditions.

## Dr. Michael (Mike) Town  
**Climate Scientist**  
Vice President and Researcher at [Earth and Space Research](https://www.esr.org/)

Like Steve, Mike dreamed of adventurous fieldwork from an early age and fulfilled this dream in graduate school, wintering at the South Pole alongside Steve in 2001. His current research focuses on the surface energy budget over polar snow.

<!-- Here is a breakdown of our team:

Dr. Stephen (Steve) Hudson (Expedition Leader) is a Senior Researcher at the [Norwegian Polar Institute](https://www.npolar.no/) and leads work package responsible for devleoping the Integrated Cloud Observatory with [TONe](https://www.npolar.no/en/tone/). His research focuses mostly on the ways in which ice and snow interact with sunlight to affect Earth’s climate. He became fascinated by the polar regions before high school, and by university, he set his sights on spending a winter at the South Pole. In 2001, he lived this dream during graduate school, sparking a passion for fieldwork that’s taken him on multiple trips to both the Arctic and Antarctic.

Marius Bratrein (Electrical Engineer) is an Instrumentation Engineer within the [Norwegian Polar Institute](https://www.npolar.no/). Marius has a broad background in electrical engineering, instrumentation, logisitics and polar exploration.  Marius has worked hand in hand with Steve to prepare everything for the expedition to Troll.

![Marius](marius.png){width=50%}

Dr Michael (Mike) Town (Climate Scientist) is the Vice President of and Researcher at [Earth and Space Research] (https://www.esr.org/). Similar to Steve, Mike also dreamed of adventurous fieldwork from an early age and had these fullfilled in graduate school by wintering over at the South Pole alngside Steve in 2001. Mike current research focuses on the surface energy budget over polar snow.
