We just landed in Prague. Annoying because I've never been here but only the crew are getting off the plane (and it's midnight). The business class level meal between Oslo and here was a pleasant surprise though.

Our flight plan is Oslo - Prague - Abuja, Nigeria -> Cape Town -> Troll. We'll stay in Cape Town for just enough time for the flight crew to rest. Then it's down to Troll, where we land on a runway made of ice. There's about a mile of ice below it before you hit rock. Sounds good, right?
